# cHooksâ„¢ KeyLogger | Paradise
<b>cHooks KeyLogger</b> - A no compromises tool made with simplicity in mind.<br>
This program will secretly run in the background while recording every keypress.<br>
It's packed with protections to ensure that it stays as undetected as possible.<br>
All keypresses will be sent to your Discord Webhook every 20 seconds.<br>
<br>
<h2>Features & Protections</h2>
> Prevents multiple instances from running to avoid chaos (improved!)<br>
> Uses <a href="https://medium.com/velotio-perspectives/an-introduction-to-asynchronous-programming-in-python-af0189a88bbb">Asynchronous Programming</a> (asyncio) to ensure that no key is missed.<br>
> Attaches itself to the startup folder. (shell:starup)<br>
> Requires BASE64 encoded webhook (reduces detections by ~10%).<br><br>
